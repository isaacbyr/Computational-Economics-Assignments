# Computational-Economics-Assignments

These assignments were for a fourth-year computational economics course I took while in university. The course was a very math heavy course, taking advantage of a lot of different algorithms. The assigments were written exclusively in python in order to be excecuted properly, you needed a decent understanding of python semantics. In the assigments most of the actual algorithms were given to us from course labs and we have to find ways to utilize them.
